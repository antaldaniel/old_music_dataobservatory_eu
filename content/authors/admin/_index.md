The [Digital Music Observatory](project/music-observatory/)  is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that links public datasets in order to provide a comprehensive view of the European music industry. The DMO produces key business and policy indicators that enable the growth of music business strategies and national music policies in a way that works both for music lover audiences and the creative enterprises of the sector. 

Its data pillars are following the structure laid out in the [Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory](post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/). 

**The Demo Music Observatory Pillars**: 

1. [Music Economy](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html)
2. [Diversity & Circulation](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity.html)
3. [Music & Society](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html)
4. [Innovation - innovative data applications](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#projects)

Music is one of the most data-driven service industries where the majority of sales are already made by AI-driven autonomous systems.  The DMO is a fully-functional service that can function as a testing ground of the `European Data Strategy`, showcasing the ways in which the music industry is affected by the problems that the `Digital Services Act` and the `Trustworthy AI` initiatives attempt to regulate. If these policies will work for the European microenterprise-dominated, complex and fragile European music ecosystem, then they are likely to make Europe fit for the digital age. 

Our automated observatory participates in the [EU Datathon 2021](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eudatathon) challenge #3.

Our Product/Market Fit was validated in the world's 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). We are currently developing this project with the help of the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/) program.
