Reprex’s co-founder, Daniel Antal and our [Listen Local curator](https://reprex.nl/project/listen-local/), Marie Zhorová participated in the MaMA Festival & Convention in Paris on 13-15 October within the [JUMP Music Market Accelerator Program](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellows/) Program. We introduced our Digital Music Observatory to national music organizations and encouraged them to try out a cooperation with us.

Our main aim was to find new users to our Digital Music Observatory, and to find partners for a future Horizon Europe R&D project to develop the scientific pillars of the Observatory in a manner that meets practical industry needs and the feature requirements laid out in hte Feasiblity Study for a Euroepan Music Observatory.

Our concept was introduced in Le Trianon to a wider audience and in one-to-one meetings to representatives of French national organizations. We have also started to investigate the possibility to cooperate with two startups to bring our data services closer to artists, labels, and publishers.
