The idea of our Digital Music Observatory was brought to the UK policy debate on music streaming by the _Written evidence submitted by The state51 Music Group_ to the _Economics of music streaming review_ of the UK Parliaments' DCMS Committee[^1].

The music industry requires a permanent market monitoring facility to win fights in competition tribunals, because it is increasingly disputing revenues with the world’s biggest data owners. This was precisely the role of the former CEEMID[^2] program, which was initiated by a group of collective management societies. Starting with three relatively data-poor countries, where data pooling allowed rightsholders to increase revenues, the CEEMID data collection program was extended in 2019 to 12 countries.The [final regional report](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/), after the release of the detailed [Hungarian](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/), [Slovak](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/) and [Croatian reports](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/) of CEEMID was sponsored by Consolidated Independent (of the *state51 music group*.)

Memorandum of Understanding to Create a Regional Music Database to Support Professional National Reporting, Economic Valuation and a Regional Music Study.”

CEEMID was eventually to formed into the *Demo Music Observatory* in 2020[^3], following the planned structure of the  [European Music Observatory](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/), and validated in the world's 2nd ranked university-backed incubator, the Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Validation Lab. In 2021, under the final name [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), it became open for any rightsholder or stakeholder organization or music research institute, and it is being launched with the help of the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator Programme](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2021-03-04-jump-2021/) which is co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union.

In December 2020, we started investigating how the music observatory concept could be introduced in the UK, and how our data and analytical skills could be used in the [Music Creators’ Earnings in the Streaming Era](https://digit-research.org/research/related-projects/music-creators-earnings-in-the-streaming-era/) (in short: MCE) project, which is taking place paralell to the heated political debates around the DCMS inquiry. After the *state51 music group* gave permission for the UK Intellectual Property Office to reuse the data that was originally published as the experimental [CEEMID-CI Streaming Volume and Revenue Indexes](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/market.html#recmarket), we came to a cooperation agreement between the MCE Project and the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/). We provided a detailed historical analysis and computer simulation for the MCE Project, and we will host all the data of the *Music Creators’ Earnings Report* in our observatory, hopefully no later than early July 2021.

We started our cooperation with the two  principal investigators of the project, [Prof David Hesmondhalgh](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/prof-david-hesmondhalgh/) and [Dr Hyojugn Sun](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/hyojung-sun/) back in April and will start releasing the findings and the data in July 2021.
