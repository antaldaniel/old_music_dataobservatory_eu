CEEMID has collected hundreds of indicators since 2014 on this topic. We would like to invite our partners to find a few relevant indicators and publish them here. Some of these indicators require explicit permission from public bodies or from partners, given existing data acquisition costs.

## Audiences

We have been carefully following the surveying guidance of the Final Report of the Working Group European Statistical System Network on Culture (in short: ESSnet-Culture) detailed guidelines can be found in the report of the Task Force on Cultural Practices And Social Aspects Of Culture.

So far, CEEMID has carried out 7 detailed, nationally representative CAP surveys for music and audiovisual use, which it retrospectively harmonized with EU 2007 and EU 2013 surveys. See further information [here](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html#audiences).


## Education, training, personal development

When we presented the case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference (see an edited version of the presentation in our [blogpost](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-01-30-ceereport/) with further details), we emphasised a very important structural problem of the creative sectors that is a very significant burden in the case of the music industry, too.

In the music industry, most enterprises are sole proprietorships, micro- or small enterprises which do not possess strategic human resources (HR) and research and development (R&D) functions. Because music is a high-labor added, high-value added sector, participation in lifelong learning programs would be crucial, but very difficult to organize. Companies with 1-2 employees do not have specialized management and support functions, and thus have a very strong handicap in HR and R&D.

> "A good example of this problem is the motion picture and TV industry. These industries were comprised of medium-sized enterprises in the 1980s with significant in-house education functions. The current structure of these industries, however, resembles music, with almost all enterprises staying below the 5-person threshold. In our experience, based on development needs assessments in the Hungarian motion picture and the Czech music industry, this creates an acute skills and labor shortage. Missing skills cannot be replaced appropriately through recruitment or with strategic HR development via life-long learning.

In addition to very reduced opportunities to participate in, and create life-long learning schemes, there are very little chances to engage in market research and R&D. While the music industry, for example, is one of the most data-driven industries in the world, the micro-enterprise size does not allow these enterprises to commission market research or hire data scientists. This leads to very asymmetrical relationships with the main distributors of music and media content on platforms that are owned by global data companies."*

Our surveys are not only asking about the professional development of music professionals, but in some cases, they are designed to create industry-level vocational training programs.
