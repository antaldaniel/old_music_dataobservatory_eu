The [music.dataobservatory.eu](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html) monitors the music markets with an economic methodology: we not only measure market volumes and prices, but we also measure both demand- and supply side indicators so that we can forecast future market volumes or prices. (See [Innovation pillar — 4.2 Forecasting](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/innovation.html))

Music is not a purely market activity. Music and music services have consumers who pay for it one way or another, but there are non-market forms of music (for example, in liturgy) and music markets are overshadowed by a very large illegal market. Therefore, instead of “music consumption” we use the more appropriate statistical terms of access and participation.
