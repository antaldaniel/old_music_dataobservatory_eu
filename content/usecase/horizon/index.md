We are looking for partners for the Horizon Europe call *Towards a competitive, fair and sustainable European music ecosystem*.

We believe that this future Horizon Europe grant call is an excellent opportunity to harness the academic knowledge about music and channel it into a future European Music Observatory. Because of its multi-million-euro funding, it can also jump start a decentralized version of the observatory, too. According to our calculations, joining the Horizon Europe call with our Digital Music Observatory would alone fulfil most of the expectation set out in the [Feasibility Study For The Establishment Of A European Music Observatory
](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/).


* Provide new/improved methodologies for capturing the economic and societal value of music.
* Develop indicators to better detect the performance of the European music sector and its contribution to economic and social development, as well as to sustainability. Promote standardised data collection about the music (sub-)sector(s) to measure the contribution of the EU music sector to the whole economy, the number of employed in the EU music sector, and music consumption on live, broadcast and digital platforms.
* Increase the transparency of the music industry, in particular the online/streaming business, through better data provision. Provide an estimation of the impact of music participation to the society.
* Provide policymakers with effective tools for measuring and enhancing the impact of EU policy making, in the context of Music Moves Europe and beyond, on the music sector.
